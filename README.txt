All credit goes to Chris Fortune for his work on bounce handler class.

I have recently started working on this project to add some basic concept to his idea.

The idea around above script is pick email from the database and process emails in bath to check their authenticity.

Future Work in progress:

  1. Creating seperate function to process email in batch.
  2. Identify and group status code as:
        a. Hard Bounce
        b. Soft Bounce
        c. Success

It will help in added the script to any campaign DB.

Plz. feel free to comment and share your ideas. It will be a great help to understand the project better.
